This took me quite awhile to get the proper version(s) installed but it actually was a lot simpler when I looked back on it.
Open PowerShell (Admin) and run the following command to install Chocolatey:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
After installation close and re-open powershell (Admin) to use Chocolatey for the rest of our instillations
Install Erlang using the following command:
choco install erlang
Install Elixir using the following command:
choco install elixir
Install VSCode using:
choco install vscode
You can check installations by using the commands:
erl -v
elixir -v
This is useful if you have compatitibility issues between the versions. 
https://www.erlang.org/  lists the current versions for Erlag and Elixir
At this point you will want to install the VSCode ElixirLS extension
You can go to the extensions sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X
Search for ElixirLS and click Install
You can then use Elixir programs on your machine, write, edit, and compile.
If you open a powershell you can run the merry christmas program by navigating to the folder in which it is saved and using the following command:
elixir merry christmas.exs
